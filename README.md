## Introduction

Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench) is a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating physical AI generation and understanding. PAI-Bench covers physical scenarios including autonomous vehicle (AV) driving, robotics, industry (smart space) and ego-centric everyday. PAI-Bench contains three subtasks:

- **PAI-Bench-G (Video Generation)**: Evaluates world foundation models' ability to predict future states given current states and control signals
- **PAI-Bench-C (Conditional Video Generation)**: Focuses on world model generation capabilities with more complex control signals such as edges, segmentation masks, depth, etc.
- **PAI-Bench-U (Video Understanding)**: Evaluates understanding of physical scenes.
